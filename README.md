# Web-API Project

This project is useful to start an web-api project with nodejs + express + code-first
We add some useful technologies like: docker, swagger, redis, passport and others will be included as we need they

The idea with this _"Skeleton Project"_ is be quick to start new projects.
Basically this project is able to make a test with basic endpoint and be able to use passport and JWT to login.
With this project running correctly, we can create our models and new endpoints.
